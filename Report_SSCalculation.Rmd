# 1. Introduction

This report outlines the sample size calculation for the study, based on statistical hypotheses, assumptions on effect size, variance, power, significance level, and missing data. The aim is to ensure sufficient power to detect significant differences in pear quality across climate scenarios.

# 2. Sample size calculation

## Study objectives

Explore the difference between pear quality scores under the impact of 4 climate scenarios.

## Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
There is no significant difference in pear quality between the climate scenarios:

$$\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4$$

**Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):**
There is at least one significant difference in pear quality score between pairs of climate scenarios:

$$\mu_i \neq \mu_j \quad \text{for} \quad i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 \quad \text{and} \quad i \neq j$$

## Statistical modelling

$$ Y_{ki} = \beta_0 + b_k + \beta_1*Variety_k + \sum_{j=1}^{3}(\beta_{2j}*Scenario_{kj}) + \sum_{j=1}^{3}\beta_{3j}Scenario_{kj}*Variety_k + \epsilon_{ki}$$

- $Y_{ki}$: the i-th observed outcome of the k-th tree, $k = 1,2...K, i = 1,â€¦.,n_K$
- $b_k$: is the random effect of the k-th tree, $b_k \sim N(0, \sigma_{tree}^{2})$
- $\beta_{0}$: the average score of the reference group (Conference type, scenario 1)
- $Variety_k$: dummy variable (1 for Doyenne du Comice species, 0 otherwise)
- $Scenario_{kj}$: dummy variable, j = 1,2,3 for scenario 2, 3, 4 respectively
- $\epsilon_{ki}$: the residual error. $\epsilon_{kj} \sim N(0, \sigma_{res}^{2})$


## Assumptions

To calculate the required sample size, we use the following assumptions:

- **Significance Level **: \( \alpha = \frac{0.05}{6} \) (adjusted for multiple comparisons)
- **Effect Size**: 10, 15, and 20
- **Variance**: The standard deviation from the pilot study is approximately 36.23, inflated by a factor of 1.1 to \( \text{SD} = 39.85 \)
- **Power**: 80%, 85%, and 90%
- **Missing Data**: data missing rate data is expected to be 10%
- Each tree contains 32 pears, and there are $\leq6$ trees per ecotron, it is required 2 ecotrons for each scenario

```

## Experimental design

Based on the table, it is observed that 175 pears per scenario are suggested to observe the minimal difference of 10 in the quality scores between 2 groups, at $\alpha = 0.0083$ and power $\beta = 0.8$. Hence, the experimental design is suggested as following:

- One ecotron per scenario, in total 4 ecotrons for 4 scenarios.
- 6 trees in each ecotron, with 3 trees for each pear species. To get a balance design, $32 \times 6 = 192$ pears per ecotron are required (96 pears for each species)
- $32 \times 6 \times 4 = 768$ pears is the final sample size. 

## Simulation

We also run 10,000 simulations for each sample size (from 120 to 300), with following parameters:

- Fixed effect size ($\delta = 15$) across all simulations
- Conservative variance at 1588 (inflated pilot SD by 10% to 39.85)
- Bonferroni-adjusted $\alpha = 0.0083$

Outcomes under the alternative hypothesis are generated (true effect exists), then two-sided t-test is performed for between the control group and one intervention group.

The simulation results indicate that with 190 observations per scenario, the observed power is 85%. This finding gives supporting evidence that the sample size that is suggested above is enough to acquire approximately 85% power.
